# Tennis-Draw: Scraping the atp world tour site and creating visuals using d3.

### D3
Followed a simple d3 example given [here](https://gist.github.com/mbostock/4339083):


### Scraping 
Scraping the information needed for the draw wasn't as pretty as I hoped. Hoping there would be a csv or a text format
that I could use, I was clearly being too optimistic. But fortunately the website had the draw structured well enough that
I could use a little wget and Beautiful Soup to parse out and store the information as json.


### End Product
In the end it worked out all right. Here is the final product [link](http://faizanrashid.github.io/tennisdraw/).
